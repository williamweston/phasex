All included PHASEX synth patches are created by William Weston

PHASEX Waveform Logo (branding) Copyright (C) 2012 William Weston
<whw@linuxmail.org>.  All Rights Reserved.  Permission is hereby
granted to use this logo to represent PHASEX (in desktop menus,
software repositories, websites indexing such repositories, etc.) as
built from the author's source packages, a clone of the author's
source code repository.  While forking of the PHASEX code is of course
permitted and encouraged by the GPL, the use of this Logo for branding
of branches outside the author's tree is not permitted.  For the
purposes of packaging PHASEX to be included in software distributions
(maintaining a local copy of the source code with patches necessary to
a function in a specific distribution) and joining in the development
effort (maintaining local branches of the source code for features
and/or fixes that will eventually be merged upstream), this
restriction need not apply.  In other words, if you fork the code and
release software from your own fork, please use a different logo for
your branding.  The intent is to improve brand recognition for all
parties involved.
